# wiiuMemo
The `wiiuMemo` API is used by Miiverse on the WiiU to interact with the drawing UI. These types provide intellisense and type safety

### _**DISCLAIMER:**_ **WIP. MANY FUNCTIONS HAVE UNKNOWN USES AND PARAMETERS, AND SOME HAVE KNOWN SIGNATURES/TYPES**

## Installation
```bash
npm i --save-dev @pretendonetwork/wiiu-memo-types
```

Once installed, `wiiuMemo` will be agumented into the global scope as well as into the `Window` interface
