# wiiuBOSS
The `wiiuBOSS` API is used by WiiU applets to interact with the BOSS (SpotPass) API. These types provide intellisense and type safety

### _**DISCLAIMER:**_ **WIP. MANY FUNCTIONS HAVE UNKNOWN USES AND PARAMETERS, AND SOME HAVE KNOWN SIGNATURES/TYPES**

## Installation
```bash
npm i --save-dev @pretendonetwork/wiiu-boss-types
```

Once installed, `wiiuBOSS` will be agumented into the global scope as well as into the `Window` interface
